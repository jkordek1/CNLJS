## WORK IN PROGRESS

Note: To fix the current KiCad 6.0 issues regarding 3D component models, add the missing KISYS3DMOD to point to the same location as KICAD6_3DMODEL_DIR

The schematic is about 80% done.

Multiple boards were produced to test how:
  - touchpads shapes affect the capacitance in order to detect the touch
  - different types of LEDs emit light through PCB and 3D printed objects
  - PCB mask affects the emitted light through PCB
